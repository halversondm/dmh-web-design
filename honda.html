<p>Recently, I restored a 1970 CD175.&nbsp; The bike had only 2400 miles when I began
repairing it.&nbsp; I had taken some pictures a couple of years ago when I wasn't able to
ride the bike (under age).&nbsp; My father had purchased the bike back in the '70s and
never really got to enjoy it.&nbsp; It sat around for years deteriorating.&nbsp; When I
was a kid the bike used to sit in front of our '69 Corvette and I used to climb on it and
pour what ever my mom gave me to drink down it.&nbsp; The bike was moved to a new town
&nbsp; in 1985 where it began it's first overhaul in 1989.&nbsp; You see my dad owned an
auto parts store with a full machine shop in the back.&nbsp; So it was very easy to clean
and assemble the bike.&nbsp; The tank needed to be replaced.&nbsp; I wonder why.
&nbsp; Also the carb needed to be cleaned with solvent.&nbsp; Amazingly to this point the
original battery was in place.&nbsp; The bike was finished and driven once and not moved
since three weeks ago.&nbsp; My father brought home a new battery and discovered that
there were more problems.&nbsp; The carb and fuel cock were soaked in Chem-Dip.
&nbsp; Right now the toughest part is keeping the tank clean.&nbsp; Of course the gas
which had not been drained out had turned into varnish.&nbsp; Currently the tank is still
a mess, but it does run.&nbsp; The bike had no other problems except the tank.&nbsp; I am
trying to devise a way to clean the tank with out ruining the paint or any rubber parts.</p>

<p>Well here are some pictures of the bike:</p>

<p>As you can see the bike looks pretty old.&nbsp; Well everything is complete right down
to the tool bag and the owner's manual.&nbsp; We also have a shop manual for it.
&nbsp; Also the sticker for where the bike was purchased is on the rear fender.
&nbsp; Grand Prix Honda in Melrose Park, IL.</p>

<p>Again these pictures were taken in 1994 but nothing has changed since then.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking time to look at my new toy.&nbsp; If you have any questions you can
